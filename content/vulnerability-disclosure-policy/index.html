          We take the security of our systems seriously, and we value the
          security community. The disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps
          us ensure the security and privacy of our users.
        </p>
        <h2>Guidelines</h2>
        <p>We require that all researchers:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>

              Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user
              experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction of
              data during security testing;

          </li>
          <li>
Perform research only within the scope set out below;
          </li>
          <li>

              Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability
              information to us; and

          </li>
          <li>

              Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered
              confidential between yourself and Reconcept until we’ve had 90
              days to resolve the issue.

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we
          commit to:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>

              Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research;

          </li>
          <li>

              Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly
              (including an initial confirmation of your report within 72 hours
              of submission);

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Please note that we do not offer financial compensation or rewards of any kind for unsolicited reports.</b></p>
